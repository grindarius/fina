          FINA (pronounced FIN-NA), short for <b>Fabulous and Interactive Numerical Analysis Calculator</b>,
          is a tool to learn Numerical Analysis. Since I found so many struggles learning this subject.
          So I decided to make this a Web App for people who wanted to study it.

                The graph component that's used to draw the graph can display false
                data when your function is not continuous, meaning it has some gaps in the function,
                or some values results in Infinity or -Infinity. If those things are found in the
                function. our grapher component will change the infected value to 0.

                There is a settings in the code where when <katex-element expression="c" /> is not any type of finite number,
                it will break the calculation loop. That condition might result in sometimes the API would send nothing back from the calculation.
